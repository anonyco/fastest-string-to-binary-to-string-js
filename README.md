# string16-js
A super lightweight javascript utility library for working with high unicode characters

# How to use/install
Simply insert the following line of code into your head before any other scripts.
```HTML
<script src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ll11ftru2az384q/string16.min.js?dl=2"></script>
```
Or, if you insterested in not being the laziest possible human being, then you can super speed up you page by adding the `defer=""` attribute to all of your scripts like so.
```HTML
<!doctype html>
<html><head>
	<script src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ll11ftru2az384q/string16.min.js?dl=2" defer=""></script>
	<script src="/path/to/other/scripts.js" defer=""></script> <!--replace this with your scripts-->
	<title>Example Domain</title>
</head><body>
	<h1>Example Domain</h1>
</body></html>
```
